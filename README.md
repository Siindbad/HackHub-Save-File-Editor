https://github.com/Siindbad/HackHub-Save-File-Editor/tree/main/dist

I'll Also add them into the "Releases" Eventually

THE PROGRAM NOW HAS AN UPDATE Button : To Update To Latest Versions When It Detects It


		[ USAGE ]

There will be a README Function Inside the application for you to view and read with small insetruction


       [ FOR EDITORS ]

1. Sin EDITOR : is for common quick fixing of small issues players may run into, and a community helper can identify them quicker with a smaller list to choose from
that entail more of the common issues people may need assistance with.

2. Sin EDITOR UNLOCKED : Is for Full Contents of a .hhsav file : helpful for scriptors or community helpers to find more content that is inside and troubleshoot more deeper issues


	   [ COMMON USAGE ]

Both Editors can be used to simply change all aspects of the information in the game. Even though is NOT Recommended to change Any Devices and IP's, it would be more common to change
things like Port Numbers that are having issues, or even bugs showing no services when there should be.

For Example : If a user has issues getting into a ROUTER due to 404 Page Error, it could be because some how it's bugged with PORT 22 when it should be PORT 80. If this was the case
you can open the save file and go into "NETWORK" Tab and find the Public IP and change that 22 to an 80 then EXPORT the save.
