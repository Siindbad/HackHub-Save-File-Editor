| Sin EDITOR is designed for quick, practical save-file fixes. It helps players and community helpers resolve common issues faster, with focused editing and clearer error guidance.<br><br>You can edit many values in a save file, but the safest use is targeted corrections (for example: ports, missing services, credentials, and similar recovery fixes). Directly changing device identities or IP structures is possible, but not recommended unless you know exactly what you are doing.<br><br>Example:<br>If a router is showing a 404 page because a port is incorrect, open the save, go to the `NETWORK` section, locate the affected public IP entry, correct the port (for example `22` to `80`), then export and import the updated save. |
