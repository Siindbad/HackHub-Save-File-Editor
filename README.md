![USAGE](https://img.shields.io/badge/USAGE-0D9488?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0F172A)

Sin EDITOR is designed for quick, practical save-file fixes.
It helps players and community helpers resolve common issues faster, with focused editing and clearer error guidance.

You can edit many values in a save file, but the safest use is targeted corrections (for example: ports, missing services, credentials, and similar recovery fixes).
Directly changing device identities or IP structures is possible, but not recommended unless you know exactly what you are doing.

Example:
If a router is showing a 404 page because a port is incorrect, open the save, go to the `NETWORK` section, locate the affected public IP entry, correct the port (for example `22` to `80`), then export and import the updated save.
